values and updater functions listed. It initializes state with some default/
dummy data: four sample VideoFiles (with filenames and durations), default
markers empty, no saved clips, overlays disabled (with default positions),
default exportSettings (16:9, 1080p, MP4), five platforms not connected, default
platformConfigs (all platforms enabled false, default privacy 'public'), and
empty publishingQueue. The provider allows any component to use the
useVideoEditor hook to access and modify these values. Functions like saveClip
and addMarker internally compute IDs and use Date.now() for unique IDs.
SelectedFiles is derived (not stored, but computed as
videoFiles.filter(selected)).",

components. For example, FileSidebar updates videoFiles selection; selectedFiles
is then used by SegmentPreview and timeline. Timeline saveClip adds to
savedClips; SavedClipsList reads it. ExportPanel toggles overlaySettings and
exportSettings; ExportSummary and VideoPlayer read those to update UI.
SocialPublishingPanel updates connectedPlatforms and publishingQueue; those
would be used if there were components showing connection status or job status
(currently mainly internal). Essentially, this context is the hub for state,
enabling decoupled components to stay in sync without direct prop drilling.",
"backendIntegration": "In a complete application, many of these
state elements would be populated or synced with backend data. For instance,
videoFiles might come from an API listing uploaded segments, savedClips could be
persisted to a database, and publishingQueue could reflect server-side job
statuses. Integration points include: initial loading of video segments, saving
clips (POST to backend), initiating video processing (which could update
publishingQueue or a separate processingQueue not currently present), and
handling social platform tokens (connectedPlatforms might be set after OAuth
callback). This context can also be a place to integrate with web socket or
polling for status updates (for publishing or processing).",
"gptNotes": "All state is currently kept in memory and resets on
refresh. It's safe to integrate API calls here or in components for persistent
functionality. Adding side effects (like fetching initial data or syncing
operations) can be done carefully via additional hooks or within provider after
initial render. The dummy data (e.g., videoFiles with .ts files) indicates where
real data should come in."

support real-time trimming: VideoPlayer needs to include an actual HTML5 <video>
element (or similar) that plays the combined selected segments or current video
file, and update context.currentTime as it plays (via timeupdate events).
TrimTimeline should reflect the actual video timeline; its slider changes should
seek the video, and conversely video playback should move the slider.
Implementing this requires connecting VideoPlayer and TrimTimeline through
context (currentTime, isPlaying) and possibly refs or callbacks. Additionally,
if multiple segments are selected, an approach is needed to play them seamlessly
(either by concatenating files on the fly, or playing sequentially and mapping
the timeline positions to segment times). These changes will allow the preview
to reflect edits in real time."

success message or link when a publish is done). Alternatively, a WebSocket or
SSE stream could push status updates instead of polling."

flow."
